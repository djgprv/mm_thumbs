Usage
-----

This plugin installs SLIR script in ROOT directory of your Wolf CMS installation. After successful installation of this plugin you can access thumbnails of your photos with:

```
http://YOURSITE.COM/thmm/__parameters__/path/to/your/image.jpg
```

Or with short URL starting with slash:

```
/thmm/__parameters__/path/to/your/image.jpg
```

To use, place an img tag with the src pointing to the path of "/thmm/" followed by the parameters, followed by the path to the source image to resize. All parameters follow the pattern of a one-letter code and then the parameter value:

 - **Maximum width** = "w" - *eg. /thmm/w100/...*
 - **Maximum height** = "h" - *eg. /thmm/h100/...*
 - **Crop ratio** = "c" - *eg. /thmm/w100-c1:2/...*
 - **Quality** = "q" - *eg. /thmm/w200-q85/...*
 - **Background fill color** (for transp. PNGs) = "b" - *eg. /thmm/bF80/...*
 - **Progressive** = "p" (for JPEG) - *eg. /thmm/h100-p/...*

Examples
--------

Resizing a JPEG to a max width of 100 pixels and a max height of 100 pixels

```
<img src="/thmm/w100-h100/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Alt text" />

Resizing and cropping a JPEG into a square:
